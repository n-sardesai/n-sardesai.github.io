Hi! My name's Neil, and I am currently studying <b>Medicine</b> at the University of Cambridge, with an intercalated Bachelor’s degree in <b>Engineering</b>. My work sits at the intersection of medicine and technology, focusing on health data science, AI, and medical devices. I have conducted research at <b>Harvard University</b> and the <b>University of Cambridge</b>, worked in <b>medical consulting</b> — both at a global firm and freelance — and presented and published internationally.

Beyond research, I lead the <b>Cambridge University MedTech Society</b> and the <b>Cambridge University AI in Medicine Society</b>, organising events, fostering innovation, and connecting students with industry leaders. I am passionate about using technology to improve patient care, advance medical science, and bridge the gap between healthcare and engineering.

I am also deeply committed to education. As a <b>Supervisor</b> for the Cambridge Physiology and Medical Statistics courses, I support students in developing a strong foundation in these subjects. Additionally, I have delivered <b>100s of hours of tutoring</b> for medical school entry, guiding applicants through admissions tests, interviews, and applications. I also co-lead the <b>Emmanuel Widening Access Programme for Medicine</b>, working to make medical education more accessible.
