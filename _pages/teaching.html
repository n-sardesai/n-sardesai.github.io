<div class="wordwrap">As a Supervisor for the Cambridge Physiology and Medical Statistics courses, I support students in developing a strong foundation in these subjects. Additionally, I have delivered 100s of hours of tutoring for medical school entry, guiding applicants through admissions tests, interviews, and applications. I also co-lead the Emmanuel Widening Access Programme for Medicine, working to make medical education more accessible.</div>
